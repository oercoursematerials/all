## Background

As UNESCO [explains](https://en.unesco.org/themes/building-knowledge-societies/oer/recommendation):

> Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching, learning and research materials that reside in the public domain and have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions. OER form part of ‘Open Solutions’, alongside Free and Open Source software (FOSS), Open Access (OA), Open Data (OD) and crowdsourcing platforms.
